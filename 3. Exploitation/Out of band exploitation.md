# Out of band exploitation

https://www.notsosecure.com/oob-exploitation-cheatsheet/

*Out-Of-Band (OOB) technique provides an attacker with an alternative way to confirm and exploit a vulnerability which is otherwise “blind”. In a blind vulnerability, as an attacker you do not get the output of the vulnerability in the direct response to the vulnerable request. The OOB techniques often require a vulnerable entity to generate an outbound TCP/UDP/ICMP request and that will then allow an attacker to exfiltrate data. The success of an OOB attack is based on the egress firewall rules i.e. which outbound request is permitted from the vulnerable system and the perimeter firewall.*

This is exactly what the Burp Collaborator server does.
